# TestGNSSr

When placing geocaches or when looking for geocaches it is always
important to know how good or bad the received signal is.

This app will provide you with the reported coordinates and the
historic statistics.

See http://ios.me/app/1303544506/chart-your-gnssr for the app in
the AppStore.


The idea for this app came after this Facebook post:

Try this thought experiment: Attach your GPS receiver to a tripod.
Turn it on and record its position every ten minutes for 24 hours.
Next day, plot the 144 coordinates your receiver calculated. What
do you suppose the plot would look like?

Do you imagine a cloud of points scattered around the actual location?
That's a reasonable expectation. Now, imagine drawing a circle or
ellipse that encompasses about 95 percent of the points. What would
the radius of that circle or ellipse be? (In other words, what is
your receiver's positioning error?)

So, to once and for all show how good, or bad, iPhones are for
geocaching, here is the hard proof.
